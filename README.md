# 32-bit-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit
The implementation in VHDL of an ALU on 32 bits for my "Structure of Computer Systems" course.

The ALU operates on 32-bit integers represented in Two's Complement and performs the following operations:
- Addition and Subtraction
- Increment and Decrement Operations
- Logical Bitwise Operations (AND, OR, NOT)
- Logical Negation Operation
- Left and Right Rotate Operations
- Multiplication and Division

An FPGA Basys3 board was used to test the implementation of the ALU.
